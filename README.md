## **Contents**

### Statistical Analysis
- [**Student Mental Health Assessment**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/personal_projects/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health%20Assessments.ipynb): Analyzed the impact of lifestyle and academic factors on student mental health using a Kaggle dataset. Implemented data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling with logistic regression to identify key influences.


### SQL Data Exploration
- [**COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/personal_projects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project%20actual%20scripts.sql): This project explores global COVID-19 trends using SQL, analyzing infection and death rates, vaccination progress, and country-wise impact. It includes data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, window functions, and views for efficient reporting and visualization.

### Visualizations

- [**Global Literacy Rates and Educational Statistics Analysis - PowerBI**](https://app.powerbi.com/links/4X6uPSLwX4?ctid=5c98fb47-d3b9-4649-9d94-f88cbdd9729c&pbi_source=linkShare) : This Power BI project visualizes global literacy rates and education trends through interactive maps, bar charts, and line graphs. It includes DAX-calculated measures to analyze gender disparities, correlations between GDP and education spending, and regional inequalities. Insights from the analysis inform policy recommendations for improving global education.
