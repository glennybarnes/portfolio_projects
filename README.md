## üìö Project Categories & Highlights

### Statistical & Predictive Analysis
- [**Academic Risk & Retention Analysis**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/academic_risk-retention-analysis): Developed a data-driven recovery and intervention strategy using academic warnings and GPA patterns. Over 5 years of data revealed that early warnings and structured support helped students recover 3x faster. Tools used: Python, Power BI, regression models, and feature importance methods.

- [**Real Estate Predictive Modeling**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/real-estate-predictive-modeling-edmonton)  
  Used machine learning to model home prices in Edmonton with **92% accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.92)**. Integrated 300K+ transaction records, crime data, and neighborhood metadata. Built SHAP-explained models using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, and visualized results with **Tableau**.

- [**Superstore Discount-Profit Analysis**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Superstore%20Discount-Profit%20Analysis.ipynb)  
  Investigated the relationship between discounts and profitability across U.S. Superstore transactions. Used statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover loss triggers and identify optimal discounting strategies by sub-category and region.

- [**Student Mental Health Assessment**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/personal_projects/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health%20Assessments.ipynb)  
  Explored how academic and lifestyle factors affect student mental health using logistic regression. Identified predictive features from survey data to support early intervention strategies.

### SQL Data Exploration

- [**COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis (SQL)**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/personal_projects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project%20actual%20scripts.sql)  
  Leveraged SQL to analyze global COVID-19 trends. Applied window functions, CTEs, and views to assess infection rates, vaccination progress, and mortality disparities across countries.

### Data Visualization

- [**Global Literacy & Education Trends (Power BI)**](https://github.com/glennybarnes/global-literacy-education-powerbi)  
  Designed a Power BI dashboard to visualize literacy and education statistics worldwide. Used DAX for dynamic measures and interactive maps to highlight GDP-education correlations, gender gaps, and policy recommendations.
