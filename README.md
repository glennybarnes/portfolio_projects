It includes data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, window functions, and views for efficient reporting and visualization.

### Visualizations

- [**Global Literacy Rates and Educational Statistics Analysis - PowerBI**](https://app.powerbi.com/links/4X6uPSLwX4?ctid=5c98fb47-d3b9-4649-9d94-f88cbdd9729c&pbi_source=linkShare) : This Power BI project visualizes global literacy rates and education trends through interactive maps, bar charts, and line graphs. It includes DAX-calculated measures to analyze gender disparities, correlations between GDP and education spending, and regional inequalities. Insights from the analysis inform policy recommendations for improving global education.
